# RayTracing
Created a rendering camera and a viewing environment for objects such as a spheres and a plane. Implemented a ray tracing algorithm to trace with depth ordering.  

 Lambert and Blinn-Phong shading are implemented with multiple lights in addition to having shadow rendering implemented as well.
